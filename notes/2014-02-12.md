Error Handling
--------------

An error condition is a condition occuring during runtime that cannot be handled by the normal flow of execution.

How
-----

* Old c style

        int c = getc(myFile);
        if (c == EOF)
          printf("End of file\n");

* top level exception class is std::exception and could be used to catch all exceptions that are derived from that.
