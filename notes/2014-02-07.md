Review
------

* RAII, must remember to get this acronym memorized, cause it keeps showing up
* typdefs with std::size_t and std::value_type
* two versions of operator []() --- look at the IntArray class for implemention
  * key things to know about how to handle constant classes and giving proper access restrictions
* given IntArray buffer(5), using &buffer[0] to provide similar access to the an int * to improve performance with things like vecotr
* RAII breaks down when it comes to circular references, c++11 has a new ptr type call a weak ptr that doesn't allow dereferencing.


Templates
---------

Introduction

* templates are the primary structure used in generic programming.
* templates can't be sperately compiled, put everything in the header (.h) file.  No source file is needed.
* c++ has function templates and class templates.

Details

* function templates (outdated in c++11, lookup to_string)

        #include <string>
        #include <sstream>
          
        template <typename T>
        std::string toString(const T & value)
        {
          std::ostringstream os;
          os << value;
          return os.str();
        } 
        
* class templates

        SingleValue<int> x;
        template <typename T>;
        void foo(const SingleValue<T> x);
    
* class comments (everytime you write a template!)

        // Class Invariants:
        // 		_data points to an ptr of type T allocated with new, owned by *this
        // Requirement on types:
        //    Num must have a copy ctor, dtor and binary operator*


Containers
----------

A container is a data structure that can hold multiple items, usually of the same type
When we deal with containers (and things that look like containers), the following broad categories of data are important
