Pointers/Exceptions
===================

* coupling: the degree of dependence between two modules
  * loose coupling: little dependence
  * tight coupling: a lot of dependence
  * some coupling is unavoidable but less (loose) is better
  
* DRY: don't repeat yourself
* SRP: Single responsibility Principle
  * Every module should have exactly one well-defined responsibility
  * a module that follows SRP is said to be cohesive
  * SRP/cohesion helps with error handling (moving files on fs or many queries in a database)

* Exceptions
  * when a function encounters an error condition, this ioften needs to be communicated to the caller
  * one way to do this is by **throwing an exception**

* Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII)
  * Ownership = Responsibility for releasing
    * can be transfered
    * can be shared (c++11 has reference-counted "Smart Pointers")
  * RAII = An object owns (and, therefore, its destructor releases)
