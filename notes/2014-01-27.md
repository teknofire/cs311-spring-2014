Review
============

* Add const after () of a function declaration to make it so that this can't be modified

Silently Written & Called functions
===================================

* 6 default functions, default ctor, copy ctor, assignment ctor, dctor, { reference, and dereference }(don't generally overload these)
* default constructor
  * only created by default when NO constructor is created
  * Initializer list - leaving things out will still call the default, 
* copy constructor
  * created when you do not declare it
  * see also Return Value optimization
* copy assignment
  * created when you do not declare it
* destrcutor
  * created when you do not declare it
    

  <code>
    class Dog {
      public:
      //default constructor
      Dog():a(),b(), c() // initializer list
      {}
      //copy constructor
      Dog(const Dog & other)
        :a(other.a), b(other.b), c(other.c)
      {}
      //copy assignment
      Dog & operator=(const Dog & rhs) // Not a ctor; no initializers
      {
        a = rhs.a;
        b = rhs.b;
        c = rhs.c;
        
        return *this;
      }
      ~Dog()
      {} // calls dctors for data members
    }
  </code>

* When to write silently written functions?
  * When you need them and not written for you
  * When you need to think about shallow vs deep copy (points shouldn't be copied in a class copy)
  
  
* c++ v11 new features
  <code>
    class Mule {
      public:
      Mule & operator=(const Mule &) = delete;
        Mule() = default;
    }
