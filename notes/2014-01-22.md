**Review**

* Methods and operators can do implicit conversion of user defined classes and types


**Parameter Passing**

* int &x = y; 
  * & means create a reference to y, can't be changed once it's assigned
* int *ptr = &y;
  * & is get address of
  * '*' create a pointer
* x = *ptr;

* _use const to trigger compile errors, making sure we don't modify things we don't want modified._
* return by value does not allow for proper calling of virtual functions
* don't return reference to local variables from functions

**Operator Overloading - Global & Member**

* Why create a global vs a member overloaded operator?
  * if we want to be able to implicitly convert the lhs then we should make sure it's a global (especially for built in types on the lhs).
  * assignment operators should be member functions
