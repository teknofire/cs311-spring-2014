Recursion
---------

* 4 questions you should ask
  * Is this approriate use of recursion?
  * How much does each call diminish the size of the problem?
  * What instance of the problem can serve as the base case?
  * As the problem size dimishes, **will you reach this base case**?
  
* Search Algorithms
  * Binary Search, Linear Search
  * some methods that can be used to make this better 
    * std::advance, std:distance
