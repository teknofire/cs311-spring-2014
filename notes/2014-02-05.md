Managing Resources in a class
=============================

The c++  standard header <cstdlib> defines some types that help in writing system-independent code
  * Type std::site_t (largest unsigned data type available)
    * an unsigned integer type big enough to hold the size of any object
    * "t" for "type"
  * Type std::ptrdiff_t
    * Like size_t, only signed, gets its name from the fact that it can hold the difference between two pointers
  
    #include <cstdlib>
    IntArray(std::size_t size)
    class IntArray {
      putlic:
      typedef std::size_t size_type;
      IntArray(size_type size);
    }
  
  * how do we make a const IntArray to prevent someone from modifying the buffer
    * answer: overloaded methods, specifically operator[], and more specifically the const at the end of the method which is part of the function signature
        
        int & IntArray::operator[](size_type i) const;
        { 
          return _data[i];
        }
  
  * adding <code>explicit</code> in front a single paramater constructor makes it so that it will only be called as constructor not part of an implicit type conversion
  * don't put <code>explicit</code> on the copy constructor
