Invariants
==========

An invariant is a condition about the value of a variable that is always true at particular point in an algorithm

* We use invariants:
  * ensure that we are allowed to perform various operations
  * remind ourselves of the information that is implicitly know in a program
  * to document ways in which code can be used
  * to help us verify that our program is correct
